You are comparing a new commitment to existing OPEN commitments to detect duplicates.

New commitment:
{new_description}

Existing OPEN commitments (id: description):
{candidates}

Respond ONLY with compact JSON in the following schema:
{{
  "duplicate_commitment_id": <int or null>,
  "confidence": <number between 0 and 1>,
  "summary": "<short reason, <= {summary_word_limit} words>"
}}

Rules:
- If no existing commitment is a duplicate, set duplicate_commitment_id to null and confidence to 0.0.
- If a duplicate is likely, choose the single best matching commitment id.
- The summary must be <= {summary_word_limit} words.
