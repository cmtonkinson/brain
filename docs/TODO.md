# TODO
- Kick off Codex to self-fix errors from the logs (need blue/green deploy though for auto-rollback stability)
- Integrate with Tactiq API for automatic pull of transcriptions into Obsidian
- Hammerspoon integration (specifically: calendar, reminders, mail, music)
- Add MCP server integration for https://github.com/XD3an/python-sequential-thinking-mcp
- Add MCP server integration for https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server
- Is Obsidian being chunked & embedded for search?
- Whitelist incoming numbers (duh)
