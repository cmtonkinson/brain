# TODO

- Integrate with Tactiq API for automatic pull of transcriptions into Obsidian
- Add MCP server integration for https://github.com/XD3an/python-sequential-thinking-mcp
- Add MCP server integration for https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server
- Is Obsidian being chunked & embedded for search?
- Whitelist incoming numbers (duh)
