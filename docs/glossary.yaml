title: "Glossary of Terms"
terms:
  - term: Actor
    definition: "A client of the Brain Core SDK, such as the Agent, CLI, or Celery Worker."
  - term: Adapter
    definition: "A Resource which governs interaction with the outside world such as an MCP Server, messaging platform, web API, etc."
  - term: Component
    definition: "An isolated unit of responsibility or work. Each Actor, Service, and Resource is a Component."
  - term: Resource
    definition: "Trustees of side effects. All real-world consequences are gated by a Resource Component. Types are `Substrate` and `Adapter`."
  - term: Service
    definition: "The primary carriers of business logic, responsible for coordinating system state and behavior."
  - term: Substrate
    definition: "A Resource which governs state, such as a database, document store, or cache."
  - term: Layer
    definition: "An abstract 'horizontal' segment of Brain architecture defined by its purpose and access control rules. There are three Layers: 0, 1, and 2."
  - term: System
    definition: "An abstract 'vertical' segment of Brain architecture defined by its ontological purpose. There are three Systems: State, Action and Control."
  - term: Public API
    definition: "The internal, native, Python surface exported by a given Service. The Public API is the canonical interface for any Service."
  - term: Brain Core SDK
    definition: "The gRPC interface generated on top of the Public API for direct consumption by Layer 2. This is the only system interface available to Actors."
  - term: Capability
    definition: "A governed, testable unit of action with a clear input/output contract, bounded authority, and inspectable results. Types are `Op` and `Skill`."
  - term: Envelope
    definition: "The structured message wrapper used for all cross-Layer and cross-Service communication, consisting of metadata, payload, and errors."
  - term: Op
    definition: "A Capability which wraps a Resource API call. Ops are the foundational units of work exposed to Actors."
  - term: Operator
    definition: "The human user of the system. All personal-assistant work rolls up to the Operator as the accountable Principal."
  - term: Principal
    definition: "The accountable identity for a request, propagated unchanged across calls in Envelope metadata. Examples: `operator`, `core`, or a Service name."
  - term: Skill
    definition: "A compound Capability implementing either a sequence of Ops or custom Python code."
  - term: Action System
    definition: "The System responsible for external consequences: comprises Services and Adapter Resources responsible for external I/O."
  - term: Capability SDK
    definition: "The SDK for definition, registration, and management of Capabilities (Ops and Skills) including logic and metadata such as Policy declarations."
  - term: Control System
    definition: "The System housing higher-order executive functions by composing functionality from the State System and Action System."
  - term: Manifest
    definition: "The self-registration declaration that each Component exports to join the global registry at import time."
  - term: State System
    definition: "The System responsible for durable data, comprised of Authority Services and Substrate Resources."
  - term: Trace
    definition: "A `trace_id`-scoped execution episode linking causally related Envelopes. Cross-trace causality is preserved via `parent_id` references."
